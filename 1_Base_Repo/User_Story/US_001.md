Description

As a First Notification of Loss (FNOL) Portal user, I want to view and manage work item cards categorized by their status: unassigned, assigned, processed, and unmatched. These cards should be visually distinct using color coding and appropriate spacing (margins). I want the ability to move assigned cards to the assigned tab and processed cards to the processed tab, making it easy to track and update the status of each work item efficiently.

In-Scope

Work Item Card UI:


Design and display cards for work items in four categories: Unassigned, Assigned, Processed, and Unmatched.

Visual color coding for each category (e.g.,light blue for unassigned, dark blue  for assigned, green for processed and so on )

Proper margins and spacing between cards for clarity and readability.

Tabs or Sections:

UI tabs or distinct sections for each status category.

Cards appear under their respective status tab/section.

Status Update:

Updating the card’s status when moved (e.g., from unassigned to assigned).
